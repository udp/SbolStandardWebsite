 abstract = {Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOLv) is a graphical notation that supports  
biological device development. It provides a formal notation for describing the physical  
composition of basic parts into composite parts during the development of biological devices. It  
is targeted for use by biological engineers in forward engineering projects. It encourages and  
supports model-driven engineering.},
