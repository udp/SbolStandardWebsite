However, manual editing of SBOL is generally difficult for nontrivial designs. Here, we describe ShortBOL, a lightweight SBOL scripting language that bridges the gap between manual editing, visual design tools, and direct programming. ShortBOL is a shorthand textual language developed to enable users to create SBOL designs quickly and easily, without requiring strong programming skills or visual design tools.","tags":[],"title":"ShortBOL: A Language for Scripting Designs for Engineered Biological Systems Using Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)","type":"publication"}]
