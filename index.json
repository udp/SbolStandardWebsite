Such a strategy can facilitate the development of more complex circuits by genetic engineering.\nCello converts electronic design specifications of combinational logic to complete DNA sequences encoding transcriptional logic circuits that can be executed in bacterial cells.

When designing a synthetic system, synthetic biologists need to exchange information about multiple types of molecules, the intended behavior of the system, and actual experimental measurements. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, following an open community process involving both wet bench scientists and dry scientific modelers and software developers, across academia, industry, and other institutions. This document describes SBOL 3.0.0, which condenses and simplifies previous versions of SBOL based on experiences in deployment across a variety of scientific and industrial settings. In particular, SBOL 3.0.0, (1) separates sequence features from part/sub-part relationships, (2) renames Component Definition/Component to Component/Sub-Component, (3) merges Component and Module classes, (4) ensures consistency between data model and ontology terms, (5) extends the means to define and reference Sub-Components, (6) refines requirements on object URIs, (7) enables graph-based serialization, (8) moves Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) for Component types, (9) makes all sequence associations explicit, (10) makes interfaces explicit, (11) generalizes Sequence Constraints into a general structural Constraint class, and (12) expands the set of allowed constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Synthetic biology open language (SBOL) version 3.0.0","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Baig","Pedro Fontanarrosa","Vishwesh Kulkarni","James McLaughlin","Prashant Vaidyanathan","Bryan Bartley","Swapnil Bhatia","Shyam Bhakta","Michael Bissell","Kevin Clancy","Robert Sidney Cox","Angel Goñi Moreno","Thomas Gorochowski","Raik Grunberg","Augustin Luna","Curtis Madsen","Goksel Misirli","Tramy Nguyen","Nicolas Le Novere","Zachary Palchick","Matthew Pocock","Nicholas Roehner","Herbert Sauro","James Scott-Brown","John T Sexton","Guy-Bart Stan","Jeffrey J Tabor","Marta Vazquez Vilar","Christopher A Voigt","Anil Wipat","David Zong","Zach Zundel","Jacob Beal","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"172630c068751adad7b96b6cdf2a8d74","permalink":"/publication/visualsbol221/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/visualsbol221/","section":"publication","summary":"People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences that they are engineering and about the functional relationships between sequence features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and conventions have begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function of genetic designs. This document details version 2.2 of SBOL Visual, which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 2.1 in several ways. First, the grounding of molecular species glyphs is changed from BioPAX to SBO, aligning with the use of SBO terms for interaction glyphs. Second, new glyphs are added for proteins, introns, and polypeptide regions (e. g., protein domains), the prior recommended macromolecule glyph is deprecated in favor of its alternative, and small polygons are introduced as alternative glyphs for simple chemicals.","tags":[],"title":"Synthetic biology open language visual (SBOL visual) version 2.2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Göksel Mısırlı","Jacob Beal","Thomas E Gorochowski","Guy-Bart Stan","Anil Wipat","Chris J Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584748800,"objectID":"6b7265f62e3e1f5b525619c4131cd7dc","permalink":"/publication/visual2ontology/","publishdate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/visual2ontology/","section":"publication","summary":"Standardizing the visual representation of genetic parts and circuits is essential for unambiguously creating and interpreting genetic designs. To this end, an increasing number of tools are adopting well-defined glyphs from the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Visual standard to represent various genetic parts and their relationships. However, the implementation and maintenance of the relationships between biological elements or concepts and their associated glyphs has up to now been left up to tool developers. We address this need with the SBOL Visual 2 Ontology, a machine-accessible resource that provides rules for mapping from genetic parts, molecules, and interactions between them, to agreed SBOL Visual glyphs. This resource, together with a web service, can be used as a library to simplify the development of visualization tools, as a stand-alone resource to computationally search for suitable glyphs, and to help facilitate integration with existing biological ontologies and standards in synthetic biology.","tags":[],"title":"SBOL Visual 2 Ontology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Crowther","Lewis Grozinger","Matthew Pocock","Christopher P.
